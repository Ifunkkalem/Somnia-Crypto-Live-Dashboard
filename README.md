# Somnia Crypto Live Dashboard: Advanced SDS Simulation

A real-time cryptocurrency dashboard built for the **Somnia Data Streams Hackathon**. This project has been upgraded to showcase advanced reactive features leveraging the SDS architecture concept.

### 🎯 Purpose 
The core feature is the **Simulated Data Stream Listener**. Instead of traditional Web 2.0 polling (fetching data repeatedly), this dApp uses a front-end listener that **reacts instantly** to simulated data being pushed by the Somnia Data Streams layer, updating prices every 1 second. This proves the dApp's readiness for ultra-low-latency Web3 data feeds.

### 🔥 Features 

* **Simulated Somnia Data Stream:** Demonstrates a reliable push-model update (SDS) every 1 second.
* **Real-Time Volatility Alerts:** Implements a crucial Web3 feature where the system instantly triggers an alert (visual pop-up and card highlight) if a crypto pair experiences a price change of **0.5% or more** in a single stream update. This demonstrates how SDS can be used for instant *smart contract* triggers (e.g., automated liquidations or insurance payouts).
* **Data Stream Activity Log:** Displays a real-time log of every data packet received from the simulated stream, proving continuous, high-throughput data processing.
* **Real-time Price Reactions:** Instant color change (Up/Down color change).
* **Neon Purple UI:** Consistent with the Somnia brand.
